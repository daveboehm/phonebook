# React / Redux / Firebase / CSS Modules - Phonebook App
### The app will essentially be a steroid infused todoapp, but for Contacts instead of todo items.

This project is more or less being used as a teaching tool for my own learningz. It'll probably go stale in a few weeks or days and I'll end up deleting the repo. As is tradition.

Goal is to finally learn React and Redux, and stop being a Vue/Vuex fanboy. Going to start with firebase as a backend for now, but would like to incorporate a mongo/graphql db, because I want to learn that shit too.
